# Telegram Bot with Webhook Integration in C#

This project demonstrates how to create and configure a Telegram Bot in C# that uses a webhook to receive and process updates. Webhooks allow your Telegram Bot to receive real-time updates, such as new messages, in an efficient and scalable manner.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Telegram Bot with webhook integration in your C# project:

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

If you haven't already, create a Telegram Bot by talking to the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram. Note down the API Token provided by BotFather; you'll need it for webhook configuration.

### 2. Set Up a Web Server

You'll need a C# web server to handle incoming webhook requests from Telegram. You can use frameworks like ASP.NET Core to build your server application.

### 3. Configure Your Bot's Webhook

To configure the webhook for your Telegram Bot, make an HTTP POST request to the Telegram Bot API with your bot's API Token. Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` and `YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` with your bot's API Token and the URL of your C# web server:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        string botToken = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN";
        string webhookUrl = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL";

        using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
        {
            string apiUrl = $"https://api.telegram.org/bot{botToken}/setWebhook?url={webhookUrl}";
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(apiUrl);

            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Webhook successfully set up!");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Webhook setup failed: {response.StatusCode}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code tells Telegram to send updates to your webhook URL whenever there are new events, such as incoming messages.

### 4. Implement Webhook Handling

On your C# web server, implement the logic for handling incoming Telegram updates. This typically involves listening for POST requests, parsing the JSON payload, and taking appropriate actions based on the update type (e.g., responding to messages).

Here's a simplified example using ASP.NET Core:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

[Route("webhook")]
[ApiController]
public class WebhookController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Post([FromBody] JObject update)
    {
        // Process the update, e.g., respond to messages
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

Customize the logic in the `Post` method to suit your bot's requirements.

### 5. Testing and Deployment

Test your bot by sending messages to it on Telegram. Your C# web server should receive webhook POST requests and respond accordingly. Once you're satisfied with the functionality, deploy your webhook to a production server for continuous operation.
